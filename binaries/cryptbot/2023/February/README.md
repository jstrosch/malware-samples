In this video, we'll take a look at a highly obfuscated .NET downloader, which uses a clever trick of redirecting STDIN of the process to avoid leaving behind PowerShell commands. We'll then investigate the open directory the payload comes from and identify how they are encrypted. We'll unravel our payload and identify the malware. Along the way we'll discuss some tips about dealing with obfuscation in .NET code and how to focus on key points of execution to quickly unravel it's logic.
